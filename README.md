This tutorial repository is a one-stop solution for understanding and mastering FastAPI, especially designed for backend API development. We bridge the gap between FastAPI and Flask, allowing you to see the comparative advantages of each. Our approach is to break down complex topics into easy-to-understand segments, aiding both beginners and experienced developers.

## Features of This Tutorial

- **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Clearly explained steps for setting up and running a FastAPI application.
- **Practical Examples**: Hands-on examples to help you understand key concepts.
- **Flask vs. FastAPI**: Insights into the differences and advantages of using FastAPI over Flask.
- **Performance Metrics**: Information on how FastAPI improves speed and efficiency.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.10 or higher is recommended.
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Installation Guide

#### Setting Up the Environment

It's advisable to create a new virtual environment for project isolation. Use the following commands to set it up:

```bash
python -m venv fastapi-env
source fastapi-env/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
fastapi-env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```
#### Installing FastAPI
FastAPI can be installed with all optional dependencies and features for a full-fledged setup:

```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]"
```
Alternatively, for a minimal setup, install FastAPI and Uvicorn separately:

```bash
pip install fastapi
pip install "uvicorn[standard]"
```

### Run the application 
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
